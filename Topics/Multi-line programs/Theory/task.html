<h2>Multi-line programs</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>We hope you have learned how to write simple, single-line Python programs that <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7139" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'print' function in Python is a built-in function used to output data to the standard output device (like a screen). | It can take various types of arguments, such as strings, integers, lists, etc. By default, the output is separated by spaces and ends with a newline. However, you can customize the separator and end character using the 'sep' and 'end' keyword arguments, respectively. Additionally, the 'print' function can handle multiple arguments, printing them out sequentially with the specified separator and end character.">print</a> text. However, real programs contain many lines: from tens or hundreds of lines for small scripts to thousands and even more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write programs that print multiple lines.</p><h5 id="ways-of-printing-multiple-lines">Ways of printing multiple lines</h5><p>Let's consider an example. The following code prints exactly three <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6842" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes. | It is a common and useful data type, often used to represent textual information. Strings can be multi-line, created using triple quotes on each side of the string literal. The Python standard library has a module called `string` that offers additional tools to work with strings. Docstrings are a common use of strings in Python, used to document classes, modules, or functions.">strings</a>, each on a new line:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
