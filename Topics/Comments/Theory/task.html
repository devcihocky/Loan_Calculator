<h2>Comments</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes you need to explain what particular parts of your code are for. Luckily, Python allows you to fulfill your needs. You can leave special notes called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6440" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A comment in Python is a piece of text that programmers add to their code to provide explanations or additional information about the code's functionality, logic, or purpose. | Comments are non-executable and do not affect the program's behavior during runtime. They are primarily used for improving code readability, maintaining code quality, and assisting other developers in understanding the codebase. Python supports both single-line and multi-line comments, with the latter being created by placing a hash symbol (#) at the beginning of each line within the comment block.">comments</a></strong>. They are especially useful for beginners.

They can be written on the same line as the code (inline comments) or span multiple lines (multi-line comments). Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, so they are typically created by adding a hash mark at the beginning of each new line. Comments are an important tool for improving code readability and understanding, especially for beginners.">hash</a></strong>,<strong> #</strong>.

The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> that follows it:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Outputs three numbers
print("1")
print("2")
print("3")</code></pre><p>We intend to use comments primarily for learning purposes. Now, it's time to find out how to comment code properly.</p><h5 id="formatting-comments">Formatting comments</h5><p>Although it is easy to write a comment, let's discuss how to do so according to the best practices.</p><p>To begin with, there should be <strong>one space</strong> after a hash mark. For inline comments, there should be <strong>two spaces</strong> between the end of the code and the hash sign. Putting more than two spaces between the end of the code and the hash mark is acceptable, but most commonly, there are exactly two spaces.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("Learning Python is fun!")  # This is proper comment formatting
print("PEP-8 is important!")#This is a very bad example</code></pre><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Indent in Python refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. | Proper indentation is crucial in Python as it defines the scope of the code block. Each statement that starts with the keyword should be indented. Indentation is used to denote nested statements, and incorrect indentation can lead to errors. It is essential to maintain consistent indentation throughout the code to ensure it runs smoothly.">Indent</a> your comment to the same level as the statement it explains. E.g., the following example is wrong:</p><pre><code class="language-python">    # this comment is in the wrong place
print("This is a statement to print.")</code></pre><p>A comment is not a Python <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/18505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'command' in the context of the command line typically refers to a directive or instruction given to the system shell or interpreter to perform a specific task or operation. | It is often entered as a line of text, following a specified syntax and format, and can include various elements such as keywords, arguments, and parameters. The command line serves as a user interface for interacting with the operating system and Python environment, allowing users to execute scripts, manage files, install packages, and access built-in functions and modules, among other things.">command</a>: it should not be too long. Following PEP-8, the comment length should be limited to 72 characters. It's better to split a long comment into several lines. You can do so by adding a hash mark at the beginning of each new line:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Imagine this is an example of a very long comment that
# we need to spread over three lines, so we continue to
# write it even here.
print("The long comment above explains this line of code.")</code></pre><p>Comments that span multiple lines are called <strong>multi-line</strong> or <strong>block</strong> comments. In Python, there is no special way to indicate them.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>You may come across multi-line comments enclosed in triple quotes: <code class="language-python">"""..."""</code>. Nonetheless, we recommend that you use several lines starting with hash marks for this purpose. Then, your code will comply with the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#block-comments" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official style guide</a>.

The choice between single and double quotes is largely a matter of personal preference, but it's worth noting that if a string contains a single quote, it's generally easier to use double quotes to enclose it, and vice versa.">quotes</a> are reserved for <strong>documentation strings</strong>, <strong>docstrings </strong>for short.
