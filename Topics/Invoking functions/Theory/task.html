<h2>Invoking functions</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Even though <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7248" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An invoking function in Python refers to the act of calling or executing a function in your program. | Functions are structured fragments of code that can be used in multiple places and times, improving code readability. When invoking a function, you write its name followed by parentheses containing its arguments, which are values used inside the function body. Python has a built-in help system to get quick references about objects, including functions, by calling the help function and passing the object as an argument."></a><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7092" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In the context of Python, 'invoke' means to call or execute a function. | When you invoke a function, you write its name followed by parentheses, which may contain arguments (values used inside the function body). The function is then executed, and it may return a result or perform some action.">invoking</a> functions in Python is not about casting a spell or the like, it does sometimes work wonders. Let's start with the concept. A <strong>function</strong> is a structured fragment of code we may want to use in more than one place and more than one time. What's more, functions allow us to read both our code and that of someone else way better. Haven't they become your favorite yet?</p>
<p>Here is a simple function call:</p>
<p><code class="language-python">multiply(1, 7)</code></p>
<p>Here <code class="language-python">multiply</code> is the name of the function, and numbers in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Parentheses in Python are used to specify the order in which operations are performed, create new values, and enclose expressions for clarity. | They can be nested inside each other and are often used with logical and arithmetic operators to ensure the correct evaluation order. Parentheses can also be used to create tuples, which are immutable data structures in Python.">parentheses</a> <code class="language-python">(1, 7)</code> are its <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an argument is a value that is passed into a function when it is called. | It is used to provide data to the function so that it can perform its intended task. Arguments can be passed either positionally or by keyword, and they can be required or optional. When defining a function, you can specify default values for optional arguments, which allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept. Additionally, Python functions can accept a variable number of arguments using the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax.">arguments</a></strong>. What is an argument? Well, it's just a value, that will be used inside the function body. Let's go deeper into it!</p>
<h5 id="invoking-print" style="text-align: center;">Invoking print()</h5>
<p>To <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7665" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, call is a term used to describe the act of invoking or using a function or method. | When you call a function, you're essentially asking Python to execute the code inside that function, often passing in some arguments to be used within the function's body. This allows for code reuse and modularity, making your programs more organized and easier to understand.">call</a></strong>, or <strong>invoke</strong>, <strong>a function</strong> in your program, simply write its name and add parentheses after it. That's all it takes! Fun fact: if you've ever typed an expression like this <code class="language-python">print("Hello, world!")</code>, you already know a little about functions. In this tiny example, however, we see the message <samp>"Hello, world!"</samp> in parentheses after the name of the <code class="language-python">print</code> function. What does it mean? This <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6842" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes. | It is a common and useful data type, often used to represent textual information. Strings can be multi-line, created using triple quotes on each side of the string literal. The Python standard library has a module called `string` that offers additional tools to work with strings. Docstrings are a common use of strings in Python, used to document classes, modules, or functions.">string</a> is just an argument. And more often than not, functions do have arguments. As for the <code class="language-python">print</code> function, we may as well use it with no argument at all or even with multiple arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, world!")
print()
print("Bye,", "then!")</code></pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Hello, world!

Bye, then!</code></pre>
<p>So, the first call prints<strong> </strong>one string, and the second call of <code class="language-python">print</code> without arguments prints, an empty line, and the last call outputs our two messages as one expression. Are you surprised by these results? Then you may learn how the <code class="language-python">print</code> function works in more detail from its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The Python documentation contains all sorts of information about the function of your interest, for example, which arguments it expects.</p>

<p>Functions can make life easier, provided one is aware of their existence. Many algorithms are already written, so there is no need for reinvention, except perhaps for educational purposes. The Python <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The interpreter in Python is a layer of software logic that executes your code, translating it line by line. | It's part of the standard Python installation package. When you write larger programs, it's more efficient to prepare your code in advance using a text editor and then run it with the interpreter. A file containing a list of operations that will be read and interpreted further on is called a script. The interpreter is responsible for translating your code into a form that the hardware can understand and execute.">interpreter</a> has several functions and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'type' refers to the classification or category of data that a variable or value can hold. | Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined during runtime, rather than at the time of variable creation. Python uses objects to store all values, and each object has a type associated with it. Type hints were introduced in Python to address common issues and enable developers to specify the expected data type of variables, function arguments, and function return values.">types</a> <strong>built into</strong> it, so they are always available. Currently, the number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A built-in function in Python is a function that is already available and does not need to be declared or imported. | It is a part of the Python interpreter and can be used directly in the code. They are always available and can make a developer's life easier by providing pre-written algorithms. The Python documentation contains detailed information about each built-in function, including its behavior, usage, and parameters. The number of built-in functions in Python 3.8 is over 60.">built-in functions</a> amounts to 69 (in the <strong>Python 3.8 </strong>version). Some of them are used to convert the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9262" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an object is a container that holds information about a value and may also store additional data such as its identity. | When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates a new object, places the value inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name to the object. Objects in Python are only accessible when the program is running and cease to exist after execution. Dictionaries are a common and convenient data type for storing various kinds of objects in Python, but they are also not available after a program has been executed.">object</a> type</strong>, for example, <code class="language-python">str()</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'return' is a statement used to exit a function and optionally specify a value to be returned to the caller. | If no value is specified, 'None' is returned by default. The execution of the function stops after the first 'return' statement encountered, even if there are more statements in the function body. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in expressions, depending on the context.">returns</a> a string, <code class="language-python">int()</code> returns an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an integer is a whole number, without a decimal point. | It can be positive, negative, or zero.

Python also has a data type called float which is used for decimal numbers.">integer</a>, and <code class="language-python">float()</code> returns a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A floating-point number in Python is a data type that represents real numbers. | It is used for statistical and scientific calculations, and it can also handle special values like infinity and not a number (NaN). Floating-point numbers are distinguished from integers by the presence of a decimal point.">floating-point number</a>. Others deal with <strong>numbers</strong>: you can <code class="language-python">round()</code> them and <code class="language-python">sum()</code> them, find the minimum <code class="language-python">min()</code> or the maximum <code class="language-python">max()</code>. Still, others give us information about the object: its <code class="language-python">type()</code> or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10963" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, the concept of length refers to the number of items in an object, such as a list, tuple, string, or dictionary. | It is determined by the built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of elements in the given object. The length of an object is also known as its size or cardinality. It is a fundamental property of a collection in Python and is used to measure the amount of data stored in an object. The length of an object can be used in various operations, such as looping, slicing, and indexing.">length</a> <code class="language-python">len()</code>. Let's consider them in action!</p>
<p>In the following example, <code class="language-python">len()</code> counts the number of characters in the string (the same goes for any <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6177" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a sequence is a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a particular order. | It includes lists, tuples, and strings. Sequences are characterized by their ability to be indexed, sliced, and iterated over. Indexing allows you to access individual elements of the sequence by their position, slicing allows you to extract a subset of the sequence, and iteration allows you to loop through the elements of the sequence. Sequences are also immutable, meaning that once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.">sequence</a></strong>, i.e. list, tuple, range, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8069" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a byte is a special data type that represents a sequence of numbers, where each number is an integer between 0 and 255. | It is used to represent binary data and is often used when working with low-level system programming or network programming.

It is important to note that bytes are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their values cannot be changed.">byte</a> sequences, byte arrays).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">number = "111"

# finding the length of an object
print(len(number))  # 3</code></pre>
<p>Then we declare the variables <code class="language-python">integer</code> and <code class="language-python">float_number</code>, convert our string to corresponding types, and write their sum into <code class="language-python">my_sum</code>. By the way, the <code class="language-python">sum()</code> function deals with iterable objects, that's why we use double parentheses. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># converting types
integer = int(number)  # 111
float_number = float(number)  # 111.0

# adding numbers
my_sum = sum((integer, float_number))</code></pre>
<p> The result is a floating-point number, which becomes clear after printing <code class="language-python">my_sum</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(my_sum)  # 222.0
print(round(my_sum))  # 222</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, you can see how to find the minimum and maximum values: in this example, the smallest number equals <samp>3</samp> and the largest number <samp>8.4</samp> (the sum of <samp>3</samp> and <samp>5.4</samp>) belongs to floats. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># finding the minimum and the maximum
integer = 3
float_number = 5.4
my_sum = sum((integer, float_number))

print(min(integer, float_number))  # 3
print(type(max(integer, float_number, my_sum)))  # </code></pre>
<p> There is far more to explore, but let's sum it up.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The beauty of functions is that we can use them without clear insight into their inner structure, and how they manage to perform what we need. If you want to put a function to good use, make sure to check its documentation or try invoking the special <code class="language-python">help()</code> function with the name of the function in question wrapped in parentheses. It saves the day when the function behaves unexpectedly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">help(len)

# Help on built-in function len in module builtins:
#
# len(obj, /)
#    Return the number of items in a container.</code></pre>
<p>Let's make a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions are meant to be reusable. You can apply them multiple times with different arguments,</li>
<li>to call a function write its name followed by parentheses and place the arguments within,</li>
<li>normally, a function has documentation, which sometimes might be of huge help.</li>
</ul>
