<h2>Basic data types</h2>

<p>Every <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/25094" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a data object is a container that stores information about a value and may also store additional data such as its identity. | When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates a new object, places the value inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name to the object. Examples of data objects in Python include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.">data object</a></strong> (a variable or a constant) has a <strong>type</strong> that describes how to keep it in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/30244" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, memory refers to the space allocated for storing data and objects used by a program. | Python has automatic memory management systems, such as reference counting and generational garbage collection, which handle memory cleanup without requiring manual intervention from the developer. This means that developers don't need to explicitly deallocate memory when writing code, as Python takes care of it automatically. However, once a program finishes executing, the memory allocated to Python objects, including dictionaries, is released and no longer accessible.">memory</a>, which operations can be applied to this object and how to execute these <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/33696" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operation in Python refers to a process that manipulates one or more values, also known as operands, using an operator. | Python supports various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. These operations can be combined in more complex expressions, and their priority is determined by Python's order of operations. Additionally, Python provides other useful operations like calculating the remainder of a division.">operations</a>.</p><p>A real-world analogy of types is given by biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. For example, all dogs you've seen have the type <em>dog</em>, but each is an individual object. Thinking about a dog as a type, you can assume some operations are available. For example, a dog can bark.</p><p>In this topic, we will consider a few of the simplest data types commonly used in programming practice.</p><h5 id="strings">Strings</h5><p>Whenever you want to use textual information in your program, you'll have to work with <strong>strings</strong>. In Python, the string type is called <code class="language-python">str</code>. Strings are extremely common and useful. As discussed, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string literal in Python is a sequence of characters surrounded by either single or double quotes. | These quotes define the beginning and end of the string. Python interprets the characters within the quotes as a single entity, allowing for the manipulation and analysis of text data. String literals can contain various characters, including spaces, numbers, and special symbols. Additionally, string literals can be defined over multiple lines using triple quotes on each side, which is useful for incorporating large blocks of text or multi-line messages.">string literals</a> may be delimited using either single or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a double quote is used to denote a string literal, which is a sequence of characters. | It is one of the two types of quotes that can be used to create strings, the other being single quotes. Double quotes are often used when the string itself contains a single quote, to avoid the need for escaping. However, the choice between single and double quotes is largely a matter of personal preference and convention, as both are functionally equivalent in Python.">double quotes</a>.</p><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in double quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print("")               # an empty string
print("string")         # one word
print("Hello, world!")  # a sentence</code></pre><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in single quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print('a')                   # a single character
print('1234')                # a sequence of digits
print('Bonjour, le monde!')  # a sentence</code></pre><p>In a real program, a string can represent an email of a person or an organization.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('hello@hyperskill.org')  # print an email</code></pre><p>As you can see, strings are very easy to use!</p><h5 id="numerical-types">Numerical types</h5><p>Numbers are essential for any programmer. You can hardly write any program without numbers, so let's discuss some basic <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numerical types are used to represent and manipulate numerical values. | There are several numerical types, including integers, float (floating point numbers), and complex numbers. Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, without decimals. Floats are real numbers with decimal points. Complex numbers are numbers with a real and imaginary component, denoted by a + bi.">numerical types</a></strong>:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-python">int</code><strong> (<a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8069" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A signed integer, also known as an int, is a numerical data type in Python that represents whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. | The term signed refers to the fact that the integer can be either positive or negative, as opposed to an unsigned integer which can only be positive or zero. Signed integers are used to count things in the real world, and they are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their value cannot be changed. In Python, signed integers are a fundamental data type and are used extensively in programming.">signed integers</a>)</strong>.

The creation of a class instance, also known as an object, allows for the customization of the initial state of that instance. Inheritance is a key feature of classes in Python, enabling the creation of new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.">class</a></em>.</p><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>We hope you now have some intuition about <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/35824" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, data types are a fundamental concept that categorizes the type of data a variable can hold. | Python has several data types, including int (integer), float (decimal), str (string), and bool (boolean). These data types have specific features and behaviors. To determine the type of an object, you can use the `type()` function. Python is dynamically typed, meaning that only runtime objects (values) have a type, not the variables that store them. This means that you can store several values of different types in a single variable during code execution.">data types</a>. You should remember the simplest types, <code class="language-python">str</code>, <code class="language-python">int</code> and <code class="language-python">float</code>, and how to write their literals. In the following topics, we will learn the specific features of each type. If you need to know the type of an object, print it using the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function.</p>
